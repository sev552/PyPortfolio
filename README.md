# PyPortfolio
Python implementation of a rudimentary financial (equities and publicly traded instruments) portfolio API

Goals:
  - Gain familiarity with Python web scraping techniques, data analysis tools (Pandas), and data visualization.
  - Write a meaningful program with real world applications, and one that is extensibile as my financial knowledge increases
