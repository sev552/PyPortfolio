# PyPortfolio
Python implementation of a rudimentary financial (equities and publicly traded instruments) portfolio API

Goals:
  - Gain familiarity with Python web scraping techniques, data analysis tools (Pandas), and data visualization.
  - Write a meaningful program with real world applications, and one that is extensibile as my financial knowledge increases
  
  
  ARCHIVED 4-6-2020 10:47am EST: I discovered the world of financial APIs... 
    - Will come back to flesh this out as proof of data cleaning ability, but why reinvent the wheel for analytical purposes
